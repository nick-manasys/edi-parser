the information necessary to uniquely identify an object, is defined as a 
package. Objects may include graphic, text, parametric, tabular, image, 
spectral, audio, etc. data. The character set repertoire of an object is not 
governed by the character set repertoire identified for any accompanying 
transaction sets contained in the interchange.

Associated data may be linked with other business transactions as an 
augmentation to other functional data. Therefore, referencing capabilities 
properly relating the object to the associated transaction set must be 
provided. Because user preferences require flexibility within the techniques 
for referring to an object, no particular methodology is specified. The only 
requirement is the assignment of an object identification number attributable 
to the object which should be unique for a sufficient time to avoid any 
confusion. Multiple references to identify all related transaction sets and 
objects are permitted.

The transaction set is not media dependent, is not limited to a specific 
transmission protocol, and can be linked to other transaction sets. 
Interchanges may contain functional groups containing transaction sets, 
packages, or transaction sets and packages. The transaction set may be included

trading partners the ability to exchange a complete or partial technical 
description of a product, process, service, etc. over the same path as any 
other EDI transaction. The detail area can include graphic, text, parametric, 
tabular, image, spectral, or audio data. A transmission includes identification 
information to assist the receiver in interpreting and utilizing the 
information included in the transaction.

Further action as a consequence of the receipt and initial processing of the 
specification or other technical data may or may not require human 
intervention. The transmission and receipt of the data may require private 
agreement between the trading partners to automate the receipt of the data.

The total transaction must be in the general form of all ASC X12 transactions 
so that an EDI computer system will be able to automatically recognize it as a 
Specification/Technical Information Transaction Set and pass it on for 
processing of the data itself. The transaction set is not media dependent.

The detail area of the Specification/Technical Information Transaction Set 
provides a structure which allows for the exchange of a variety of 
specification information. For example, if the transaction contains information 
describing a complete assembly, it would be necessary to include the assembly 
model, the models for each of the individual parts, and the associated 
specifications. In the case of a process it may be necessary to transmit the 
specification of the product along with the specifications of the process and 
raw materials. This transaction set can also be linked to other transaction 
sets.

This transaction set is not limited to a specific transmission protocol and 
uses other standards as applicable where they do not conflict with these 
requirements for specification transaction.

This X12 Transaction Set contains the format and establishes the data contents 
of the Material Safety Data Sheet Transaction Set (848) for use within the 
context of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) environment. The transaction 
set can be used to communicate chemical characteristics, hazards, and

intended to convey the information required for a Material Safety Data Sheet 
(MSDS) as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 in the United States, and 
Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHIMS) in Canada, and various 
state, province, and local requirements under right-to-know legislation.

The MSDS provides the receiver with detailed information concerning material 
identity, emergency response, chemical and physical characteristics, 
toxicology, and industrial hygiene procedures.

State and federal law dictate who is obligated to provide the MSDS and to whom 
it should be issued. In addition, third-party providers or others with no 
statutory obligation may voluntarily provide an MSDS to anyone.

This transaction set allows for transmission of MSDS data in a structured, 
unstructured, or semi-structured form.

CAUTION: With this transaction set, text format is critical due to the MSDS's 
primary role as a vehicle for hazards communication. The risk if this 
information is not transmitted clearly and accurately could be harmful to human 
life, harmful to the environment, could cause mishandling of product, could 
result in regulatory non-compliance, and could result in liability.

Trading partners need to agree on how to interpret, store, and display/print 
MSDS text, especially text contained in the MSG and SD1 segments. For example, 
a sender may wish to format text so that one print line is mapped to one MSG 
segment. Segment terminator and data element delimiter characters shall not 
appear in any MSDS data.

WARNING: Alteration of the original document will occur if the EDI translator 
or application software converts characters to uppercase. This may adversely 
affect the appearance, effectiveness, clarity, readability, and communicability 
of the printed MSDS document.

This X12 Transaction Set contains the format and establishes the data contents 
of the Shipment and Billing Notice Transaction Set (857) for use within the 
context of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) environment. This transaction 
set provides the recipient of a shipment with data for both receipt planning 
and payment generation.

EDI and telecommunications technologies suggest efficiencies in the way 
business data is processed. For example, the sender of a shipment may send the 
recipient's receiving function a Ship Notice/Manifest (856), and the payables 
function an Invoice (810), even though the contents of these two documents may 
be largely redundant. In certain business environments, the Shipment and 
Billing Notice permits the consolidation of these two documents into one.

Specifically, this transaction set is appropriate where the shipment data, when 
it includes terms and item prices, can be used both to plan receipts and to 
generate payment. In this environment, the exact prices for the items shipped 
may not be known in advance by both parties. This transaction set is not 
appropriate in so-called Evaluated Receipts Settlement (ERS) environments, in 
which the exact prices for the items shipped have been agreed upon by, and are 
known to, both parties in advance.

This transaction set is not to be used to replace the Ship Notice/Manifest 
(856) or Invoice (810) individually, but only to replace both, together. For 
example, do not use this transaction set in place of a Ship Notice/Manifest 
while continuing to send either paper or electronic invoice.

It is the intent of this transaction set to provide electronic communication 
(messages) for people, not for computer processing. The use of the transaction 
set to transmit quasi or unique transaction set standards is discouraged.

140,1,0200,N,1
BGN02 is used as the initial reference identifier for this transaction. BGN03 
defines the date of this registration transaction. Normally BGN04 and BGN05 
would not be used in this transaction. BGN01 is normally set to 00 to indicate 
that this is an original registration. Product registration is normally a 
by-product of a sale.
*SETNTE
140,1,0300,N,1
The N9 segment can provide a reference to a previous registration transaction. 
For example, this could be a replacement of a previous registration

*SETNTE
140,1,0400,N,1
The N1 loop defines the party submitting the product registration, usually the 
seller of the product rather than the customer, and the party who maintains the 
registration database, usually the manufacturer of the product. The N1 loop 
also can be used to specify the product's distributor.
*SETNTE
140,2,0100,N,1
Each iteration of the LX loop is used to group one or more products that are 
being registered to one individual or organization.
*SETNTE

The REF segment is used to identify the individual registration number. It can 
include the data element 128, code value Q8, "Registration Number."
*SETNTE
140,2,0200,N,1
The N1 loop is used to identify the individual or organization responsible for 
the registration. This could be the purchaser, the lessee, the operator, etc. 
This is the party registered to be notified if a product recall is required. 
Successive iterations could identify other individuals and organizations who 
are involved in some manner. It also could be used to specify if the product is 
to be installed or housed at a location that is different than that listed for 
the registration.
An additional use of the N1 loop has been requested to be able to include the 
salesperson who sold the product or service contract and the service manager 
who would be responsible for servicing the product.
*SETNTE
140,2,0600,N,1
The PER segment is used to provide an individual's or department's name for a 
particular support function and, if desired, their communication number for a 
phone, electronic mail, etc.
*SETNTE
140,2,0800,N,1
The REF segment could be used to identify the item into or onto which this 
product being warranted will be residing. For example, when a controller is 
attached to a numerically controlled machine tool, part of the registration 
could include information about the machine tool. The machine tool could be 
identified with multiple occurrences of the REF segment. A similar situation 
would be if an engine were being replaced in a heavy duty truck. The REF 
segment could then be used to specify the vehicle.
*SETNTE
140,2,0900,N,1
There is a separate LIN segment for each product included in this sale 
represented by the single iteration of the LX loop. The LIN segment will 
contain the product's model number and serial number in data element 234-235 
combinations. The other pairs can be used to provide other information about 
the product.
*SETNTE
140,2,1000,N,1
The PID segment can be used to provide additional information regarding the 
product. However, it seldom will be required. When it is used, PID06, data 
element 752, is not required.
*SETNTE
140,2,1100,N,1
The QTY segment is used to reflect the quantity of items that do not have a 
serial number. QTY01 will have a discrete quantity qualifier of 01. For all 
items with a serial number, the value to be used is either explicitly or 
implicitly set to one.
*SETNTE
140,2,1200,N,1
The DTM segment in the LIN loop can be used to specify the dates that are 
significant to the registration such as delivery, installation, placed in 
service, failed, brought in for service, etc.
*SETNTE
140,2,1300,N,1
The REF segment can identify information about the product that was not able to 
be coded in the preceding segments. For example, it can be used to specify the 
warranty coverage code and the warranty registration number.
*SETNTE
140,2,1400,N,1
The N1 loop within the LIN loop provides the same capabilities for the single 
product as the N1 loop above in the LX loop provides for the entire sale.
*SETNTE
140,2,1800,N,1
The PER segment is used to provide an individual's or department's name or 
functional area and, if desired, their communication number for a phone, 
electronic mail, etc.
*SETNTE
140,2,1900,N,1
The PSC loop in the LIN loop refers to the warranty or service contract for the 
entire product described by the LIN segment. If special operating conditions 
that could affect the registration are to be noted, such as a household product 
being used commercially, this would be placed in the PSC segment. Unless noted 
to the contrary, it will be assumed that the product will be used in its most 
normal capacity. For example, a kitchen appliance, unless specifically stated 
to the contrary, will be assumed to be used within a household.
The PSC loop also may be used when a for fee registration is being specified, 
such as an extended warranty or service contract. The PSC segment also may be 
used without the other segments in the loop to describe conditions of a 
standard, free warranty registration.
The PSC segment is used to specify the period for the warranty or service 
contract.
There may be other measures of service life of a product such as operation 
counter, an odometer to measure mileage of a vehicle, or a clock that measures 
operational hours.
*SETNTE
140,2,2000,N,1
The SSS special service segment is used in conjunction with the PSC segment to 
add any extra services to be specified within the service contract. For 
example, there may be a clause for 24 hour service or a guaranteed service 
response of no more than so many hours.
*SETNTE
140,2,2100,N,1
The repeated use of the AMT segment within the PSC loop allows the total amount 
of the contract to be specified as well as any special conditions on the 
amount.
*SETNTE
140,2,2200,N,1
The CUR segment is only required when the service contract is to be paid across 
national boundaries.
*SETNTE
140,2,2300,N,1
The ITA segment would be used in those special cases where the normal service 
contract cost does not apply. For example, in fleet sales, the product and its 
service contract may be bought from a local dealer, but because one purchaser 
buys many of them from several dealers spread across a geographic area, they 
get a discount or extra service on the purchase.
*SETNTE
140,2,2400,N,1
The TXI, Tax Information segment, can be used to list the sales tax paid on a 
service contract. Also it identifies the taxing authority.
*SETNTE
140,2,2500,N,1
The ITD segment is to be used in the case where the service contract is to be 
paid at regular intervals over the life of the contract. For example, the 
payments might be monthly or quarterly.
*SETNTE
140,2,2600,N,1
The N9 segment within the PSC loop can contain a unique code identifying the 
terms of the service contract. For example, repair order number or contract 
number as preassigned by the product's manufacturer. It also can be used to 
record the customer's method of payment for a service contract. It then would 
be used to contain the check number or charge card number. The expiration date 
on the charge card does not need to be recorded as the computer program 
entering the transaction only has to check that the card has not expired. N903 
will be able to contain the name of the issuer of the card.
*SETNTE
140,2,2700,N,1
The SLN loop is used to describe subassemblies or parts within an assembly that 
may be covered by separate warranty conditions.
A pair of data elements 234 and 235 in the SLN segment will be used to contain 
the serial number, lot number, model number, etc. of the subassembly being 
registered.
All the loops and segments within the SLN loop perform the same functions for 
the subassemblies as their counterparts above did for the product.
*SETNTE
140,2,3200,N,1
The N1 loop within the SLN loop provides the same capabilities for the single 
product as the N1 loop above in the LX loop provides for the entire sale. 
However, the assembly whose information is in the N1 loop is part of the 
product specified in the SLN loop.
*SETNTE
140,2,3600,N,1
The PER segment is used to provide an individual's or department's name or 
functional area and, if desired, their communication number for a phone, 
electronic mail, etc.
*SETNTE
141,1,0200,N,1
The BGN segment must contain a number for reference to this claim response 
transaction and the date on which the transaction was created.
*SETNTE
141,1,0300,N,1
The QTY segment can be used to specify the total quantity of claims included in 
this transaction as well as the quantity approved and the quantity disapproved.
*SETNTE
141,1,0400,N,1
The N1 loop defines the party making the product service claim response and the 
party to receive the response.
*SETNTE
141,1,0900,N,1
This is the representative who reviewed the entire claim response and the 
appropriate communication numbers.
*SETNTE
141,2,0100,N,1
The LX loop serves only to separate the individual product service claim 
response levels. Consequently, the LX segment would probably contain only a 
sequential number.
*SETNTE
141,2,0150,N,1
See the Figures Appendix for an explanation of the use of the REF segment in 
the LX loop.
*SETNTE
141,2,0200,N,1
The PCS segment identifies the status of the item specified by the repeated REF 
segments.
*SETNTE
141,2,0300,N,1
The DTM segment clearly is an optional segment that tells any date or time 
information that is significant to that particular claim status level. It can 
be repeated, if necessary.
*SETNTE
141,2,0400,N,1
The MSG segment seldom should be used. It is only necessary if the coded 
warranty claim status in the PCS segment is not sufficient to describe the 
detail as to a change in a submitted claims. It can be repeated to allow a full 
length message. However, the use of the MSG segment inhibits computer 
processing of the transaction by either party.
*SETNTE
141,2,0500,N,1
The optional AMT segment would be used if the amount of the individual claim 
that will be credited or submitted needs to be specified.
*SETNTE
141,2,0600,N,1
This is the representative who analyzed this individual claim and the 
appropriate communication numbers.
*SETNTE
141,2,0700,N,1
This is the factory assigned root cause for the problem specified in the 
original product service claim and should be entered only when it differs from 
that used in the original claim or was not included with the original claim. It 
should not be used to repeat back information that was contained in the 
original claim.
*SETNTE
141,3,0100,N,1
TDS01 in the trailer is able to contain the total amount to be credited or paid 
on the sum of all claims contained in this response transaction.
*SETNTE
141,3,0150,N,1
The amounts contained in the AMT segment will represent a detailed breakdown 
for the entire claim. The total amount to be credited or paid on the sum of all 
claims is to be specified in the preceding TDS segment.
*SETNTE
141,3,0200,N,1
The CUR segment will be used only if it is necessary to convert from one 
currency to another to pay for these claims.
*SETNTE
142,1,0200,N,1
BGN02 contains the warranty reference number. This could be a batch number for 
a group of claims. It will be used in LIN03 in the corresponding product 
service claim response transaction (141). BGN03 contains the product service 
claim transaction original creation date.
*SETNTE
142,1,0300,N,1
The N1 loop identifies the sending party, usually the servicing organization, 
and the receiving party, usually the product's manufacturer. In addition, a 
third party, such as the product's distributor, can be identified. It is also 
possible to specify a secondary warranter such as a credit card issuer or a 
motor oil manufacturer.
*SETNTE
142,1,0700,N,1
An independent servicing agency, usually identified as the sending party in the 
first iteration of the N1 loop, has a servicing contract with the manufacturer, 
usually the receiving party identified in the second iteration of the N1 loop. 
The REF segment in the N1 loop can contain the identity of this servicing 
contract between the two parties.
*SETNTE
142,1,0800,N,1
The PER segment within the N1 loop of the heading area is used to refer to an 
individual for administrative purposes. It is not intended to be the one with 
whom technical issues would be discussed. The technical contacts would be 
contained in the PER segment within the N1 loops in the detail area. PER02 can 
be used to identify a person by name or job function or department.
*SETNTE
142,2,0100,N,1
The LX loop represents an individual claim. Normally a claim will be for an 
independent product, assembly, subassembly, or component. However, a single 
claim also can be used for a group of similar products to be submitted to a 
single party.
*SETNTE
142,2,0200,N,1
N902 in the first or only occurrence of a N9 segment at this position in the LX 
loop must contain the reference number for all charges in this iteration of the 
LX loop.
*SETNTE
142,2,0300,N,1
The LIN loop must be used to describe the product being serviced. The LIN 
segment contains 235-234 data element pairs that can be used to identify the 
product manufacturer (MF), model number (MN), serial number (SN), equipment 
identification number (EM), vehicle identification number (VV), model year 
(RY), etc.
*SETNTE
142,2,0400,N,1
The PID segment provides capability for further description of a product that 
cannot be described in an LIN segment. PID03 to PID05 can be used to described 
these features, such as the cab configuration of a vehicle.
*SETNTE
142,2,0450,N,1
The LOC segment is used to describe the position of equipment within a 
structure or an assembly, subassembly, or part within a piece of equipment in 
space relative to an origin. For example, it could describe the location of a 
telephone switch within a building and of an individual circuit card within the 
switch by giving the position of a drawer within a rack within a switch.
*SETNTE
142,2,0500,N,1
The QTY segment in the LIN loop reflects the quantity of items that do not have 
a serial number and are being serviced together under one repair order. For all 
items with a serial number, the value to be used is either explicitly or 
implicitly set to one.

It also can specify the current service life such as miles, kilometers, or 
hours of the product being serviced.
*SETNTE
142,2,0600,N,1
The DTM segment could contain product related dates such as product delivery 
date (035), acceptance date (301), service requested (211), returned to 
customer (212), purchased (304), and manufacturer (094).
*SETNTE
142,2,0700,N,1
The REF segment provides additional data about the product, its registration 
data and servicing environment that don't fit well within the LIN segment 
either because it requires too much extraneous data to be sent or the required 
codes are not available in the codes lists of the data elements within the LIN 
segment, but are available within the Reference Number Qualifier data element 
used in the REF segment.
*SETNTE
142,2,0800,N,1
The PER segment lists the contact at the servicing location for technical 
questions regarding the repair or condition of the product. This could be the 
service manager or service technician.
*SETNTE
142,2,0900,N,1
The PSC segment describes the status of the warranty, the type of warranty, 
recall notice, service bulletin, or service contract or other conditions for 
the product that could allow a service claim in effect at the time of service, 
if any. It also identifies the service contract number in PSC05.

The PSC segment is used to describe the period of the warranty or service 
contract.
*SETNTE
142,2,1000,N,1
The SSS segment can be used to describe conditions such as carry-in or on-site 
service.
*SETNTE
142,2,1040,N,1
The LM/LQ loop provides the capability to use an industry or company code list 
to specify the area of the product under repair.
*SETNTE
142,2,1100,N,1
The N1 loop will be used to specify the parties involved with the item being 
serviced. It could be the registered owner (RW), the one who requested service 
(SQ), the one who is to be notified when the service has been completed (N1), 
the item's owner (OW), the initial dealer (ID), or any combination of them.

The N1 loop is optional. If the product had been registered, the ownership data 
should already be available and can be accessed by the model and serial numbers 
that are placed in the LIN segment.

The N1 loop also can be used to identify individuals in the service shop 
associated with this claim. For example, it could be used to identify the 
individual who received the item from the customer and wrote the repair order 
(OE).

Another possible use for the N1 loop is to identify who pre-approved the claim. 
The N9 segment within the N1 loop would be used for the appropriate 
authorization number.
*SETNTE
142,2,1600,N,1
The PER segment in the N1 loop can give the communications contact information, 
such as telephone number, of an owner's representative (OS) who can supply 
additional information about the complaint.
*SETNTE
142,2,1700,N,1
The PRR loop describes the reported problem. It can be a product recall or 
service bulletin as well as a customer complaint. Each iteration of the PRR 
loop describes a single problem. The complaints should be in a coded format 
contained in PRR04 so that the transaction can be processed by a computer 
program. The PRR segment can have a code that describes the urgency or severity 
of the problem.
*SETNTE
142,2,1800,N,1
If necessary, the LIN segment describes the portion of the entire product 
causing the complaint. For example, it may be a subassembly or component. If 
more than one subassembly is having a problem, each would be identified in a 
separate PRR loop. The LIN segment contains 235-234 data element pairs that can 
be used to identify the product manufacturer (MF), model number (MN), and 
serial number (SN).
*SETNTE
142,2,1850,N,1
The LOC segment is used to describe the position of equipment within a 
structure or an assembly, subassembly, or part within a piece of equipment in 
space relative to an origin. For example, it could describe the location of a 
telephone switch within a building and of an individual circuit card within the 
switch by giving the position of a drawer within a rack within a switch.
*SETNTE
142,2,1900,N,1
The QTY segment can specify the quantity of components or subassemblies that do 
not have a serial number and are being serviced together under one service 
order. For all items with a serial number the value to be used is either 
implicitly or explicitly set to one. The QTY segment can also specify the 
current service life of the component or subassembly, such as mileage or time. 
The equivalent information regarding the entire product should be contained in 
the QTY segment within the LIN loop.
*SETNTE
142,2,2000,N,1
The DTM segment can be used, for example, to report the time of failure (319) 
or when service was performed on the unit (302).
*SETNTE
142,2,2100,N,1
The MSG segment can be used to describe the customer's complaint. Non-standard 
complaints that can't be coded in PRR04 can be placed here. This, however, 
limits the possibility of having a computer completely process the claim.
*SETNTE
142,2,2200,N,1
The RC segment can specify the principle part involved in the failure in RC02. 
If a part number is specified in RC02, then the condition of the part must be 
included in either RC06 or RC07. Any free-form description of the root cause 
should be included in RC08. The use of RC08 will probably require human 
analysis.

It may be that a root cause is entitled only to fixed reimbursement.
*SETNTE
142,2,2300,N,1
The PER segment lists the contact at the servicing location for technical 
questions regarding the repair condition of the component or subassembly.
*SETNTE
142,2,2400,N,1
The PSC segment describes the status of the warranty, the type of warranty, 
recall notice, service bulletin, or service contract or other conditions for 
the assembly or subassembly that could allow a service claim in effect at the 
time of service, if any. If the assembly or subassembly has a separate service 
contract that is different than that for the entire product, it can be 
identified in PSC05.
*SETNTE
142,2,2500,N,1
The SSS segment can be used to describe conditions that pertain only to the 
assembly or subassembly.
*SETNTE
142,2,2600,N,1
The CID segment describes a particular portion of the product which has 
individual test specifications. For example, the tuner in a television set.
*SETNTE
142,2,2700,N,1
The TMD segment specifies a code test procedure which will be used in the 
analysis of the customer's complaint.
*SETNTE
142,2,2800,N,1
The MEA segment provides the results of any testing done before performing the 
service. Unless noted otherwise, this same test usually will be performed at 
the completion of the service activity. The preceding CID specifies the test 
conditions.
*SETNTE
142,2,2900,N,1
Some tests may require being run at various intervals of time. The time the 
separate tests were run is specified here.
*SETNTE
142,2,3000,N,1
The LIN segment can contain the identity of the test equipment, if significant.
*SETNTE
142,2,3100,N,1
The REP loop is used to describe the actions that were taken in servicing a 
problem. There can be a separate REP loop for each individual repair action, 
such as for each part replaced or individual adjustment.

If this repair was the result of a service bulletin, then the bulletin number 
would be specified in REP03.

A repair action can be identified in REP08 or REP09. For example, it could be 
the replacement of a part or assembly (RT), performing a calibration (CL), 
performing an alignment (AL), soldering a component (SD), etc. The repair 
action (REP08) should be in a coded format so that the transaction can be 
processed by a computer program.

REP01 can be used to identify the repair action line number for use in the 
product service claim response in LIN09 to identify this individual repair 
action.
*SETNTE
142,2,3200,N,1
If you want to refer to a problem or a repair listed earlier in the 
transaction, REF02 provides an identifier to the relevant PRR loop (PRR01) or 
to a relevant earlier REP loop (REP01). REF01 would contain the qualifier of 
"prior identifier". For example, if this is an REP loop to calibrate a circuit 
because a printed circuit board was replaced, REF02 would be used to refer to 
the REP loop where the printed circuit board was replaced. This also could be 
used to refer to a reported problem by referencing PRR01.
*SETNTE
142,2,3300,N,1
The N1 segment provides an identifier to the individual or organization that 
authorized this particular repair.
*SETNTE
142,2,3400,N,1
The root cause, specified by the RC - Root Cause segment, is the ultimate 
reason why this particular repair action had to be performed. For example, a 
loose lubrication fitting could result in the loss of lubricant which caused an 
assembly to fail. The root cause of this particular repair action then would be 
the loose lubrication fitting.
*SETNTE
142,2,3500,N,1
The DTM segment specifies dates and, if necessary, times that are important to 
the service operations performed on the product. For example, it can include 
the time service was requested, when the product was presented for service, the 
actual repair start and stop times, and when the product was returned to the 
customer after the completion of the service. Such detailed time information 
could be vital if there was a service contract that had a penalty if the item 
was out of service for more than a specified period of time.
*SETNTE
142,2,3550,N,1
The LIN segment within the REP loop is intended to be used to specify the parts 
used in the service action.  The manufacturer, model and serial number, 
location on product, etc. can be specified.
*SETNTE
142,2,3600,N,1
The MSG segment can be used to describe a non-standard repair action. This, 
however, limits the possibility of having a computer completely process the 
claim. The use of a standard repair action in REP08 rather than putting a 
reason in an MSG segment allows computer processing of the claim.
*SETNTE
142,2,3650,N,1
The LM/LQ loop provides the capability to use an industry or company code list 
to specify the area of the product under repair.
*SETNTE
142,2,3700,N,1
The MEA loop is for any tests that are run at the completion of the repair to 
prove that the product is now able to operate within the specifications as 
given in the CID loop within the PRR loop above. The function of segments 
within this MEA loop are the same as in the MEA loop above.
*SETNTE
142,2,3800,N,1
This is used, for example, when time is significant in the test procedures.
*SETNTE
142,2,3900,N,1
The LIN segment can contain the identity of the test equipment, if significant.
*SETNTE
142,2,4000,N,1
The IT1 segment is used to specify a charge associated with the servicing of 
one item. For example, each of the individual parts or assemblies can be 
specified by part number. It also can list the labor operation number and the 
standard labor hours for this repair.

Each occurrence of IT101 within a single transmission must be a unique 
alphanumeric string. Therefore, it is possible, but not required, to use 
sequential numbers as the identifier in IT101.
*SETNTE
142,2,4050,N,1
The LIN segment within the IT1 loop is intended to be used to specify the parts 
or supplies that are being charged against the service action.
*SETNTE
142,2,4100,N,1
The N1 segment is the source of a purchased replacement part.
*SETNTE
142,2,4200,N,1
The N9 segment, if necessary, can contain the invoice number for the purchased 
replacement part. It refers back to the previous N1 segment which identified 
the source of the part.
*SETNTE
142,2,4300,N,1
The PRT segment specifies the actual or specified disposition of the replaced 
part identified by the IT1 loop.
*SETNTE
142,2,4400,N,1
The ITA segment specifies summary charges for each REP loop. This can include 
any special service charges, a minimum labor charge, and miscellaneous charges.
*SETNTE
142,2,4500,N,1
AMT01 contains the amount claimed for this LX loop. The AMT loop contains 
financial data for the entire claim. Of course, the transmission could have 
been composed of more than one claim. If so, table 3 will contain the summary 
financial data for the entire transaction.
*SETNTE
142,2,4600,N,1
The TXI segment specifies the taxes, usually sales tax, for each of the taxing 
jurisdictions that can be involved in this particular claim.
*SETNTE
142,2,4700,N,1
One or the other of the CUR segments in table 2 or 3 can be used, but not both. 
In table 2, CUR represents the currency in a single iteration of the LX loop. 
In table 3, it represents the currency for the entire transaction. CUR segments 
will only be used if there are two different currencies involved in the claim. 
For example, the claim is being submitted to a firm in the United States and 
the work was done in Canada and the claim is to be paid in Canadian funds.
*SETNTE
142,3,0100,N,1
The TDS loop in table 3 is used to accumulate the total costs and charges 
associated with all items being claimed in this single transaction. This loop 
is placed at the end rather than the beginning of the transaction to supply the 
grand total and to simplify processing the accumulated values.
*SETNTE
142,3,0200,N,1
The TXI segment specifies the taxes, usually sales tax, for each of the taxing 
jurisdictions that can be involved in this entire transaction.
*SETNTE
142,3,0300,N,1
The currency used specifies that for the entire transaction these are the 
currency conversion rates. The CUR segment in this TDS loop should not be used 
if the CUR segment was used in one or more iterations of the preceding AMT 
loop. That would have indicated that some of the individual claims within this 
transaction were to be paid in one currency and others in another currency.
*SETNTE
143,1,0200,N,1
BGN02 is used as an initial reference for this transaction. BGN03 defines the 
date of this Product Service Notification transaction.
*SETNTE
143,1,0300,N,1
The DTM segments, if used, contain sequentially the date by which the work 
should be completed.
*SETNTE
143,1,0500,N,1
The N1 loop defines the party submitting the product recall notice or service 
bulletin and the succeeding iterations reference the parties to whom the recall 
notice or service bulletin is to be sent. When there is to be only a single 
recipient, the N1 loop will be used twice.
*SETNTE
143,2,0100,N,1
The LIN segment is used to explicitly describe the item being recalled or on 
which there is a product service notification. The LIN segment contains 235 - 
234 data element pairs that can be used to identify the product manufacturer 
(MF), model number (MN), serial number (SN), equipment identification number 
(EM), vehicle identification number (VV), model year (RY), etc.
*SETNTE
143,2,0200,N,1
The PID segment provides capability for further description of a product that 
cannot be described in an LIN segment. PID03 to PID05 can be used to describe 
these features, such as the cab configuration of a vehicle. PID05 may contain a 
free-form description of the product. If so, PID01 must be "X." If PID05 is not 
used, PID01 will be an "S." PID02 will be set to "08," "product." PID06 is not 
used.
*SETNTE
143,2,0300,N,1
The REF segments are used to contain the serial number of the item being 
recalled or to be serviced, a list of all serial numbers, a range of serial 
numbers to indicate the first and last items in the sequence being recalled or 
on which the product service notification has been issued. Obviously, there are 
other phrases that could be substituted for serial number, such as engineering 
change number, vehicle identification number, or lot number as used in the case 
of food or pharmaceutical products. At least one REF, DTM or QTY segment is 
normally required for each LIN loop. Usually the REF segment in the detail area 
is used to carry this information. The REF segment in the header would be used 
when this is considered administrative information rather than detailed 
information.
*SETNTE
143,2,0350,N,1
The LOC segment is used to describe the position of equipment within a 
structure or an assembly, subassembly, or part within a piece of equipment in 
space relative to an origin. For example, it could describe the location of a 
telephone switch within a building and of an individual circuit card within the 
switch by giving the position of a drawer within a rack within the switch.
*SETNTE
143,2,0400,N,1
The CID segment is used to specify the service characteristics affected by the 
change to the listed product. CID04 and CID05 are used to describe the 
characteristics that are affected. CID05, when used, contains a free-form 
description of the affected characteristic.
*SETNTE
143,2,0500,N,1
The DTM segment can be used to specify the first and last manufacturing or ship 
dates involved in the recall or service bulletin. The DTM segment finds its 
principal use when no REF segment can be used. That is, when there are no 
serial numbers that can be used. If desired, the DTM segment can be used in 
addition to the REF segment.
*SETNTE
143,2,0600,N,1
The QTY segment is used to reflect the quantity of items that are being 
specified in this individual instance of the product service notification, it 
known, The QTY segment most likely would be used when serial numbers or date 
codes are not applicable.
*SETNTE
143,2,0650,N,1
The PWK (paperwork) segment is used to identify the type, title, and version 
number of a hard copy report associated with the service bulletin or recall 
notice. Note that as it is a hard copy document it cannot be processed by a 
computer. Thus, it is recommended that the use of this segment be avoided.
*SETNTE
143,2,0700,N,1
The N1 loop is used to identify any individual or organization who is 
registered as the person to notify in case of a product recall or for required 
service, such as an engineering change.
*SETNTE
143,2,0900,N,1
The maximum use of the N3 segment has been set at three to allow a separate 
field for each identifier for the location of a piece of equipment within a 
facility or of an assembly, subassembly, or part within a piece of equipment. 
Examples have been found where there are seven individual items of location 
required. If the count for the N3 segment was smaller, it would be necessary to 
concatenate some of this information.
*SETNTE
143,2,1100,N,1
The REF segment identifies the serial number of the items involved in the 
notification under the control of the party named in the N1 segment. This could 
be a fleet owner or dealer for automobiles.
*SETNTE
143,2,1250,N,1
The QTY (quantity) segment is used within the N1 loop to identify the total 
quantity of the parts, sub-assemblies, assemblies, or products located at the 
address specified in the N1 loop.
*SETNTE
143,2,1300,N,1
The PRR loop is used to identify the problem or problems that caused this 
recall, change notice, or service bulletin. One single problem may require the 
PRR segment to be repeated several times. The PRR segment can contain a code 
that describes the urgency or severity of the problem.

If the problem is with the product, the PRR segment would be required. However, 
if the problem is in a subassembly, it will be necessary to use the SLN loop. 
When the SLN loop is used its PRR loop becomes mandatory. Thus, either the PRR 
loop in the basic LIN loop is required or the PRR loop within the SLN loop is 
required. Seldom would both be required within a single occurrence of the 
transaction.
*SETNTE
143,2,1400,N,1
The MSG segment is used for additional textual information with respect to the 
problem report that cannot be coded or as may be required by law or as needed 
to completely cover notification or product change reason information. It is 
carried within MSG01. The multiple use of the MSG segment allows the 
instructions to be as long and complex as required. It is good practice to not 
allow sentences to straddle the boundary of the MSG segment. It is virtually 
imperative that individual words do not cross the boundary of an MSG segment. 
It must be noted that normally it is not possible to process the textual 
information contained in the MSG with a computer program. Thus, it is much 
better to use coded data.
*SETNTE
143,2,1430,N,1
The N9 loop within the PRR loop is used to identify the additional free-form 
messages in the following MSG segment with regard to the problem, feature, 
change, etc. that is affected. This would be used rather than the previous MSG 
segment only when discrete identifiers must be associated with the messages. It 
is capable of containing a date and time associated with the message.
*SETNTE
143,2,1450,N,1
The MSG segment is used for additional textual information with respect to the 
problem report that cannot be coded or as may be required by law or as needed 
to completely cover notification or product change reason information. It is 
carried within MSG01. The multiple use of the MSG segment allows the 
instructions to be as long and complex as required. It is good practice to not 
allow sentences to straddle the boundary of the MSG segment. It is virtually 
imperative that individual words do not cross the boundary of an MSG segment.

*SETNTE
143,2,1500,N,1
The REP segment or segments are used to describe the recommended repair action 
or the return to the manufacturer for this iteration of the PRR loop
*SETNTE
143,2,1600,N,1
The MSG segments within the REP loop are used to describe verbally a service 
action whenever the repair or product change service instructions can not be 
encoded. The MSG segments are associated with the previous REP segment. The use 
of the multiple MSG segment allows the instructions to be as long and complex 
are required. It is good practice to not allow sentences to straddle the 
boundary of an MSG segment. It is virtually imperative that the individual 
words do not cross the boundary of the MSG segment. It must be noted that the 
use of the MSG segment is an inhibitor for full computer processing of the 
transaction set. Thus, coded values should be used whenever possible.
*SETNTE
143,2,1700,N,1
The QTY segment within the REP loop is able to contain the service hours 
required for this repair action. They can be either the hours allowed or the 
actual service hours.
*SETNTE
143,2,1800,N,1
The N9 loop within the REP loop is used to identify the additional free-form 
messages in the following MSG segment with regard to the repair or change 
action that is affected. This would be used rather than the previous MSG 
segment only when discrete identifiers must be associated with the messages. It 
is capable of containing a date and time associated with the message.
*SETNTE
143,2,1900,N,1
The MSG segment within the N9 loop within the REP loop is used whenever there 
are further service instructions that must be uniquely identified by the 
preceding REF segment. The multiple use of the MSG segment allows the messages 
to be as long as required.
*SETNTE
143,2,2000,N,1
The PRT loop is used to identify the disposition of a product assembly, 
subassembly, or part and where to ship them.
*SETNTE
143,2,2100,N,1
The following Nn segments can be used to tell where to return a product or 
assembly or to send it for disposal.
*SETNTE
143,2,2500,N,1
The REF segment can contain the return authorization code.
*SETNTE
143,2,2700,N,1
The ITA segment specifies if there is to be a credit adjustment or fixed amount 
for a required repair or engineering change.
*SETNTE
143,2,2900,N,1
The SLN loop is used to describe assemblies or subassemblies or parts within an 
assembly that may be the specific cause of the product service, change notice, 
or recall notification, in whatever assembly they appear. If they appear in 
more than one product family, each product family would required a separate 
transaction, although they could be grouped within a single transmission. It 
would be unusual to find problems or engineering changes reported in both the 
basic LIN loop and its SLN loop.
*SETNTE
143,2,3000,N,1
The REF segments are used to contain the serial number of the item being 
recalled or to be serviced, a list of all serial numbers, a range of serial 
numbers to indicate the first and last items in the sequence being recalled or 
on which the product service notification has been issued. Obviously, there are 
other phrases that could be substituted for serial number, such as engineering 
change number, vehicle identification number, or lot number as used in the case 
of food or pharmaceutical products. At least one REF, DTM or QTY segment is 
normally required for each LIN loop. Usually the REF segment in the detail area 
is used to carry information. The REF segment in the header would be used when 
this considered administrative information rather than detailed information 
about the product.
*SETNTE
143,2,3050,N,1
The LOC segment is used to describe the position of equipment within a 
structure or an assembly, subassembly, or part within a piece of equipment in 
space relative to an origin. For example, it could describe the location of a 
telephone switch within a building and of an individual circuit card within the 
switch by giving the position of a drawer within a rack within the switch.
*SETNTE
143,2,3100,N,1
The DTM segment can be used to specify the first and last manufacturing or ship 
dates involved in the recall or service bulletin. The DTM segment finds its 
principal use when no REF segment can be used. That is, when there are no 
serial numbers that can be used. If desired, the DTM segment can be used in 
addition to the REF segment.
*SETNTE
143,2,3200,N,1
The N1 loop is used to identify any individual or organization who is 
registered as the person to notify in case of a product recall or for required 
service, such as an engineering change.
*SETNTE
143,2,3600,N,1
The REF segment identifies the serial number of the items involved in the

of the multiple MSG segment allows the instructions to be as long and as 
complex as required. It is good practice not to allow sentences to straddle the 
boundary of an MSG segment. It is virtually imperative that the individual 
words do not cross the boundary of an MSG segment. It must be noted that the 
use of the MSG segment is an inhibitor for full computer processing of the 
transaction. Thus, coded values should be used whenever possible.

*SETNTE
997,1,0400,C,1
The data segments of this standard are used to report the results of the 
syntactical analysis of the functional groups of transaction sets; they report 
the extent to which the syntax complies with the standards or proper subsets of 
transaction sets and functional groups. They do not report on the semantic 
meaning of the transaction sets (for example, on the ability of the receiver to 
comply with the request of the sender).
*SETNTE
999,1,0100,N,1
Neither the 997 nor the 999 Acknowledgment shall be acknowledged, thereby 
preventing an endless cycle of acknowledgments of acknowledgments.  Nor shall a 
Implementation Acknowledgment be sent to report errors in a previous 
Implementation Acknowledgment.
*SETNTE
999,1,0100,N,3
There is only one Implementation Acknowledgment Transaction Set per 
acknowledged functional group.
*SETNTE
999,1,0100,N,4
Only one acknowledgement, either a single Transaction Set 997 or a single 
Transaction Set 999, should be generated for a functional group unless mutually 
agreed upon.
*SETNTE
999,1,0200,N,1
AK1 is used to respond to the functional group header and to start the 
acknowledgment for a functional group. There shall be one AK1 segment for the 
functional group that is being acknowledged.
*SETNTE
999,1,0200,N,2
The Implementation Acknowledgement is generated at the point of translation, 
intended for the originator (not any intermediate parties).
*SETNTE
999,1,0200,N,3
The Functional Group Header Segment (GS) is used to start the envelope for the 
Implementation Acknowledgment Transaction Sets. In preparing the functional 
group of acknowledgments, the application sender's code and the application 
receiver's code, taken from the functional group being acknowledged, are 
exchanged; therefore, one acknowledgment functional group responds to only 
those functional groups from one application receiver's code to one application 
sender's code.
*SETNTE
999,1,0300,N,1
AK2 is used to start the acknowledgment of a transaction set within the 
received functional group. The AK2 segments shall appear in the same order as 
the transaction sets in the functional group that has been received and is 
being acknowledged.
*SETNTE
999,1,0700,N,1
The CTX Segment shall be used to disambiguate a reported error that is 
dependent on context.
*SETNTE
999,1,0800,N,1
If any implementation guide errors have been reported in IK3 or IK4, then code 
I5 shall be reported in the IK5 Segment.
*SETNTE
999,1,0400,C,1
The data segments of this standard are used to report the results of the 
syntactical analysis of the functional groups of transaction sets; they report 
the extent to which the syntax complies with the standards or proper subsets of 
transaction sets and functional groups as expressed in compliant implementation 
guides. They do not report on the semantic meaning of the transaction sets (for 
example, on the ability of the receiver to comply with the request of the 
sender).

Part 1 (Country codes) of the ISO 3166 international standard establishes codes 
that represent the current names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of 
special geopolitical interest, on the basis of lists of country names obtained 
from the United Nations.  Part 2 (Country subdivision codes) establishes a code 
that represents the names of the principal administrative divisions, or similar 
areas, of the countries, etc. included in Part 1.  Part 3 (Codes for formerly 
used names of countries) establishes a code that represents non-current country 
names, i.e., the country names deleted from ISO 3166 since its first 
publication in 1974.  Most currencies are those of the geopolitical entities 
that are listed in ISO 3166 Part 1, Codes for the Representation of Names of 
Countries. The code may be a three-character alphabetic or three-digit numeric. 
The two leftmost characters of the alphabetic code identify the currency 
authority to which the code is assigned (using the two character alphabetic 
code from ISO 3166 Part 1, if applicable). The rightmost character is a 
mnemonic derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. For 
currencies not associated with a single geographic entity, a 
specially-allocated two-character alphabetic code, in the range XA to XZ 
identifies the currency authority. The rightmost character is derived from the 
name of the geographic area concerned, and is mnemonic to the extent possible. 
The numeric codes are identical to those assigned to the geographic entities 
listed in ISO 3166 Part 1. The range 950-998 is reserved for identification of 
funds and currencies not associated with a single entity listed in ISO 3166 
Part 1.

The Brussels Nomenclature includes the rules for the interpretation of the 
nomenclature, the section and chapter notes, and the headings. Each heading is 
identified by four digits, the first two indicating the chapter number and the 
second two the numerical order in which the heading appears within that 
chapter. The heading numbers are shown in the first column, and the texts of 
the headings are printed in heavy type in the third column. These provisions 
(interpretative rules, section and chapter notes and numbers and texts of the 
headings), and they alone, form the Brussels Nomenclature. The third column 
also contains, in smaller type, the text of the statistical sub-headings 
recommended by the council for the purposes of correlation between the BTN and 
the SITC, revised. The number of the item in the SITC, revised, keyed to each 
BTN heading (or statistical sub-heading) is shown in the second column. The 
SITC, revised, Item Number can therefore be found for any BTN heading (or 
statistical sub-heading). Conversely, starting from a known SITC, revised, Item 
Number, the corresponding BTN heading (or statistical sub-heading) can be found 
by using the correlation table. The SITC, revised, Item Number can therefore be 
found for any BTN heading (or statistical sub-heading). Conversely, starting 
from a known SITC, revised, Item Number, the corresponding BTN heading 
(statistical sub-heading) can be found by using the correlation table.
*CSABST
11
An identification code for commodities transported by motor carriers.
The commodity code is a six-digit numeric of the form: dddddd
A seventh digit is added where necessary to indicate supplementary information 
such as density ranges, different forms of shipment, special packaging 
requirements, etc.
*CSABST
12
A classification and identification code for commodities that enter external 
trade, i.e., all goods whose movement into or out of the customs area of a 
country adds to or subtracts from the material resources of the country.

The SITC code is a 2 to 5 digit numeric of the form:

d=section
dd=division
ddd=group
ddd.d=subgroup ddd.dd=item

The code enables analysis of data at successively more detailed aggregates.
*CSABST
13
A numeric code that identifies commodities that are transported by multi-modal 
carriers in the U.S.

The STCC code is a 2 to 7 digit numeric that may identify a commodity, a 
product class, an individual industry, a minor industry group, or a major 
industry group. The code is of the form:

dd=2-digit level=major industry group
dd d=3 digit level=minor industry group
dd dd=4 digit level=an industry
dd ddd=5 digit level=product class
dd ddd dd=7 digit level=description of an article

The number of digits indicates the level of a given code in the hierarchical 
structure of the STCC. The higher the level number, the more detailed is the 
data represented by the code.

A code of 49 at the 2 digit level identifies a hazardous material or substance. 
This code is of the form:

dd=2 digit level=hazardous material or substance
dd dd=4 digit level=hazard class as designated by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation
dd ddd=5 digit level=hazard class group
dd ddd dd=7 digit level=U.S. Department of Transportation proper shipping name 
or description (bridged to descriptions coded at 2 digit levels 01 through 47)

This international standard relates to an identification marking code for 
freight containers which is intended to provide information on both containers 
and the documentation and communications associated with their movement. The 
information is presented in such a manner as to be informative to operating 
personnel upon visual inspection and is suitable for automatic data processing.

Data elements are derived from: Annex B, Size Code Designations: 2 numeric 
characters; Annex C, Type Code Designations: 2 numeric characters.

The hazardous materials section (group 49) of the STCC is organized according 
to the kind and degree of hazard associated with hazardous materials or 
hazardous substances, with special provision to relate the identified commodity 
to its product class with the established commodity code structure. Available 
on tape (Washington) or in book form (Chicago).
*CSABST

The  D-U-N-S Number is a non-indicative nine-digit number assigned and 
maintained by Dun & Bradstreet to identify unique business establishments. 
D-U-N-S Numbers are assigned to businesses worldwide. The ninth digit of the 
D-U-N-S Number is a Modulus Ten Check Digit which catches 100% of single digit 
errors and 98% of single transposition errors. D-U-N-S Numbers provide positive 
identification of business locations possessing unique, separate, and distinct 
operations. Through the D-U-N-S Number, Dun & Bradstreet maintains linkage 
between units of an organization to easily identify corporate family 
relationships, such as those between headquarters, branches, subsidiaries, and 
divisions. The D-U-N-S Number is the non-indicative computer "address" of a 
business for which detailed marketing and credit information is maintained by 
Dun & Bradstreet.
*CSABST
17
The standard carrier alpha code (SCAC) lists and codes transportation 
companies. The SCAC program contemplates that each company will be assigned a 
unique two to four letter (alpha) code for use as an abbreviation or to 
identify a particular company for transportation data processing purposes. The 
combination of letters used by any one carrier does not conflict with those 
assigned to other carriers, even though such other carriers may belong to a 
different mode.

The SCAC directory contains two sections. Section 1 is an alphabetical 
arrangement of carrier names. Section 2 is an alphabetical arrangement of 
carrier codes.

The Standard Carrier Alpha Code directory is available as a printed directory 
or as a data file on CD-ROM and 9-Track Tape.

The standard point location code is designed to provide each point originating 
freight and each point receiving freight with a unique six-digit code number so 
constructed as to identify the point with its geographic location.

SPLC is based on a system of nesting recognized entities and numbering them in 
a standard geographic pattern. The system is state-county-city (point) using 
two digits to identify each. Different nomenclatures for areas equivalent to 
these three are substituted as they occur. Commonwealth, province and territory 
are synonymous with state, while parish, municipio and census district or 
census division are synonymous with county. Cities, borough, municipalities, 
rail stations, towns, villages, named rural areas, or the like, constitute the 
point list.

To identify motor carrier locations requiring definition beyond the six-digit 
level, as defined above, the SPLC is appended with an additional three digits 
referred to as the sub-code. The sub-code is assigned in conjunction with 
existing six-digit SPLC. Certain groups of sub-codes are reserved for use as 
follows:

Sub-Codes 001 - 199 Parts of (example: Georgetown part of Washington, DC).

Sub-Codes 200 - 239 Colleges, Universities, Hospitals, Prisons, Museums, Post 
Offices, Stadiums, Buildings - including government (non-military).

Sub-Codes 240 - 299 Military Facilities.
240 - 249 Air Force
250 - 259 Army
260 - 269 Coast Guard
270 - 279 Defense Logistics Agency
280 - 289 Marine Corps
290 - 299 Navy

Sub-Codes 300 - 499 Plant Sites, Warehouses, Power Stations, Docks, Piers.

Sub-Codes 500 - 599 Delivery Zones.

The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as 
the Harmonized System (HS), is a multipurpose goods nomenclature combining in a 
single integrated instrument the descriptions required for customs tariffs, 
statistical nomenclatures, and transport classifications. The role of the 
Harmonized System in many other areas such as for tariff-related negotiations, 
determination of origin of a commodity, etc. is becoming increasingly 
important. The Harmonized System consists of structured nomenclature (5,018 
groups of goods identified by a six-digit code) and is provided with necessary 
definitions and rules to ensure its uniform applications. It is supplemented by 
Explanatory Notes, an Alphabetical Index, a Compendium of Classification 
Opinions, and Trailing Modules. An Electronic HS Commodity Data Base, providing 
an enormous listing of commodities traded internationally with their 
corresponding 6-digit HS code numbers, is now under preparation. All United 
Nations economic classifications use the HS subheadings as building blocks. 
Thus, for examples, all of 3,118 basic headings in the SITC, Revision 3 are 
correlated to the 5,018 HS subheadings. The content of each SITC heading 
corresponds to one or more of the HS subheadings to which it is keyed.

The PI GRID codes uniquely identify each natural gas facility at a physical 
location (latitude/longitude). These facilities include gas wellheads and 
active completions, interconnects, entry points to pipelines, delivery points 
to local distribution companies and end-users, gas processing points, 
compressors, offshore production platforms, storage facilities, and LNG import 
terminals. Due to the unique structure of the PI GRID Location and Facility 
Code, multiple facilities at a given location are easily identifiable.

The PI GRID Facility Code is a unique 16 character code. The first five 
characters of the PI GRID Facility Code utilize established American Petroleum 
Institute (API) state and county codes, while the sixth through the tenth 
characters are random. Together, the first ten characters uniquely identify a 
physical "point" on a map. These ten digits are referred to as the PI GRID 
Location Code. In some transactions, these 10 digits (composed of the state, 
county, and location codes) are all that must be communicated. The next six 
characters describe the type of facility, distinguish multiple facilities of a 
given type at a location, and may identify parts of a facility (e.g., intake or 
tailgate at a processing plant). Each PI GRID Facility Code is associated with 
a facility name and a facility operator.

PI GRID Facility Codes are cross-referenced with the corresponding pipeline 
nonstandard codes (variously called meter numbers, station numbers, point of 
interest numbers, location codes, receipt point codes). By utilizing the PI 
GRID codes as a common code, natural gas industry participants may translate 
back and forth from PI GRID Location and Facility Codes to the individual 
nonstandard codes used by each pipeline.
