This directory set is the official approved version of UN/EDIFACT
Draft Directory D.96A.

Following the preparation of the directory by the Directory
Production Team, it was examined by the Directory Audit Team,
(DAT) which has confirmed in a report to the EDIFACT Steering
Group (ESG) that the content was prepared in accordance with
approved procedures and is considered satisfactory for trial
implementation.  (However, see the DAT comment in the Annex to
this Audit Statement, with respect to messages in the D.96A Draft
Directory which are shown having a Status of 2 for the first
time, as compared to earlier directory publications).

A copy of the full audit report submitted to ESG is available
from the UN/ECE secretariat.

The directory is the final version of the D.96A for user
implementation.  Under no circumstances will any corrigenda,
addenda or revisions be issued.

If during implementation a user identifies what is considered to
be an error, this should be notified in a Data Maintenance
Request (DMR) to allow possible amendments in a subsequent Draft
Directory.

A DMR form can be obtained from the regional EDIFACT Board
secretariat, who will advise of the process to be followed for
its submission and may assist in the completion of the form.  The
text section of the "Business Needs" section, of this DMR, should
read "Possible Draft Directory Error".

      Audit Statement for the Draft Directory D.96A - Annex

In the report of the forty-second session of WP.4 (TRADE/WP.4/193
of 7 November 1995) the following decision was reported in
paragraph 42.:

"It was further noted that GE.1 had agreed that the financial
messages, as reflected in Annex B to the GE.1 Report
(TRADE/WP.4/GE.1/101), had now completed all of the procedures
necessary for Status 2 and were now effectively at Status 2 in
the D.95B directory and that this would be reflected in the D.96A
directory."

The list of financial messages shown in Annex B to the GE.1
Report were as follows:

AUTHOR;  BANSTA;  COMDIS;  CREADV;  CREEXT;  CREMUL;  DEBADV;
DEBMUL;  DIRDEB;  DOCADV;  DOCAMA;  DOCAMI;  DOCAMR;  DOCAPP;
DOCARE;  DOCINF;  FINCAN;  FINSTA;  PAYEXT;  PAYMUL;  PAYORD;
RECECO.

Arising from the above decision, implementors should note that
with the exception of CREADV;  CREEXT;  DEBADV;  PAYEXT  & PAYORD,
none of the messages listed above were shown as having a Status
of 2 in the D.95B Draft Directory.

In the case of the five messages listed above, they also exist at
Status 2 in the S.93A Directory Set (with their versions shown in
D.95B also existing at Status 2).

It should be noted that the first time the remaining 17 messages
shown in the full list above have been shown as having a Status
of 2, is in the D.96A Directory Set, BUT that it is their message
content/structure, and the segment, composite data element, data
element and code set directories published in the D.95B Directory
Set which should be used to implement the messages at Status 2.

Further, it should be noted that ALL other messages NOT listed in
Annex B of the GE.1 Report, which are shown as having achieved a
Status of 2 (at some time in the past) in both the Draft D.95B
and D.96A Directory Sets, continue to be supported only by
the full and complete S.93A Directory Set (i.e. including their
message segment table structures), for implementation as Status 2
messages.
