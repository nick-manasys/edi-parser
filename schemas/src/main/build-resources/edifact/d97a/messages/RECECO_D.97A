0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Credit risk
       cover message (RECECO) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional Definition

       Factoring companies provide their clients (the seller)
       protection against the risk of credit losses on sales to the
       buyers. Credit protection is provided on each approved customer
       (buyer) of the seller.
       
       The message will be used to apply for preliminary credit
       assessment (used during negotiation with prospective clients);
       apply for credit protection; reply to credit requests; revise
       amount and expiry date of credit protection and terms; cancel
       credit protection.
       
       The message will serve at the same time as the request for
       credit risk cover and as the answer (approval or rejection to
       that request).

1.2    Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       settlements. It is based on universal commercial practice and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The flow of communication is from Seller to Factor (request),
       and from Factor to Seller (answer). The Seller must provide
       information regarding the Buyers (name, address, etc.) and
       information regarding the expected amount of sales to be risk
       covered. The Factoring company will provide an answer, after
       due credit investigation.
       
       The credit cover may be a 'line cover' or an 'order cover'. A
       line cover relates to the sales of one seller to one buyer, up
       to the agreed limit. An order cover relates to a specific order
       (or shipment).
       
       - one credit cover may relate to one or more line covers; 
       - one credit cover may relate to one or more order covers; 
       - for each distinct period there is only one line cover; 
       - one credit cover must relate to one buyer; 
       - one credit cover must relate to one seller.
