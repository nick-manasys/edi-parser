Audit Statement for the UN/EDIFACT Standard Directory
=====================================================

This directory set is the official approved version of UN/EDIFACT
Standard Directory 
D.97A.

Following the preparation of the directory by the Directory Production
Team, it was examined by the Directory Audit Team, (DAT) which has
confirmed in a report to the EDIFACT Steering Group (ESG) that the
content was prepared in accordance with approved procedures and is
considered satisfactory for implementation. 

A copy of the full audit report submitted to ESG is available from the
UN/ECE secretariat.

The directory is the final version of the D.97A for user
implementation.  Under no circumstances will any corrigenda, addenda or
revisions be issued.

If during implementation a user identifies what is considered to be an
error, this should be notified in a Data Maintenance Request (DMR) to
allow possible amendments in a subsequent Standard Directory.

A DMR form can be obtained from the regional EDIFACT Board secretariat,
who will advise of the process to be followed for its submission and
may assist in the completion of the form.  The text section of the
"Business Needs" section, of this DMR, should read "Possible 
Standard Directory Error".
