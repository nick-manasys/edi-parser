0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Forwarding
       and consolidation summary message (IFCSUM) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to be used for consolidation purposes from a party
       arranging forwarding and transport services to the party for
       which the transport of the consolidated cargo is destined.
       The message can be used to exchange information concerning the
       consolidated cargo between forwarders, carriers and agents
       enabling those parties to handle the consignments included in
       this consolidation.
       In addition it can be used for a collection of consignments
       originating from one shipper for forwarding and transport
       services.
       In addition it can be used for an advice of insurance related
       to a consolidation of consignments if the insured is the party
       arranging forwarding and transport services.

1.2    Field of application

       The Forwarding and consolidation summary message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The IFCSUM message is a functionality in its own right,
       distinguishable from the transport booking and instruction
       messages.
       IFCSUM focuses on separate business areas in transport where
       the view on the operations is transport means or equipment
       oriented rather than consignment oriented. These business areas
       do not concentrate on concepts like booking or instruction. The
       IFCSUM provides currently merely a statement for a means of
       transport or equipment and their summary type information
       regarding the consignment carried. The IFCSUM message also
       provides a means to incorporate the control and auditability
       information needed for the receiver of the message to perform
       the operation to be carried out.
       
       IFCSUM is foreseen to be used:
       - in the consolidation and deconsolidation industry (stuffing
       and stripping of consignments in containers)
       - in the groupage and degroupage industry (the full load
       description of rail-cars and road vehicles)
       - in the collection and distribution industry (as the
       description of all consignments to be collected together (maybe
       from different places) and delivered at possibly different
       places in a certain region)
       - for the declaration of dangerous cargo by ship's agents to
       their Port Authorities (as listing of the dangerous cargo
       carried or to be carried by as means of transport).
       
       The message provides information concerning cargo carried on a
       voyage specifying details regarding carrier, mode of transport,
       means of transport, equipment and the necessary details of the
       consignments included in the consolidated cargo.
       Under given circumstances a cargo manifest can be obtained
       through the use of the IFCSUM.
       For example, a IFCSUM message can be used in groupage traffic,
       where it may correspond to a loading list indicating the
       consignments that have been loaded on a truck.
       
       There is a need for FUNCTIONAL SUBSETS to be derived from the
       message, for example:
       
       - CONSOLIDATION ADVICE giving information about the departure
       of a voyage/flight or consolidation to the receiver.
       
       - CONSOLIDATION STATUS giving information about the departure
       of a voyage/flight or consolidation to principals (e.g. carrier
       to freight forwarder, consolidator to co-loader etc.).
       
       - CONSOLIDATION REPORT giving information about the arrival and
       unloading, clearance, etc. from the receiver to the sender.
       According to the different information requirements of
       carriers, carrier's agents, and freight forwarders for the
       different modes of transport like air, deep sea, inland
       waterways, rail, road, combined- and/or multimodal- transport
       different modal subsets can be derived from this message.
       
       There is a need for INTRAMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted
       between partners of the same mode of transport (e.g. railway to
       railway in different countries, deep-sea-carrier to deep-sea
       carrier, freight forwarder to freight forwarder etc.).
       
       There is another need for INTERMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted
       between partners in a multimodal transport (e.g. freight
       forwarder to trucker, trucker to railway, railway to port
       authority, port authority to carrier's agent, carrier's agent
       to carrier etc.).
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers,
       and a single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff
       codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried
       in one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
       (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one
       booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each
       step specified with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
       transported on another load or transport device, which as such
       may be attached to or transported on yet another load or
       transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed
       at up to three levels.
       
       For insurance purposes the message can be used by the carrier
       to inform the insurer and/or the insurance intermediary about a
       consolidation of consignments.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.

                         MOA-FTX-GDS-SG31-SG32-SG33-SG34-SG36-SG37-
                         SG38-SG39-SG44-SG51-SG71
       A segment group to give information about all consignments
       included in a voyage/flight or consolidation. The segment group
       can be used in two different manners to serve different
       approaches to consolidate messages: 
       
       - Short form consolidation message
       
       In this situation, single consignment based functional messages
       (e.g. booking and/or instruction messages) have been sent on a
       progressive basis between exchanging partners (e.g. freight
       forwarder on the export side to freight forwarder on the import
       side).
       When the loading of the vessel/aircraft or consolidation is
       complete the IFCSUM-message will be sent and will use the CNI-
       segments to identify the transport document/message number
       (e.g. bill of lading, air-way bill, etc.) of every consignment,
       the details of which have already been sent as separate single
       consignment based messages (e.g. booking and/or instruction
       messages) or which will be sent as separate single consignment
       based messages following the IFCSUM-message using the option of
       grouping with the UNG-service-segment in a transmission.
       When the carrier himself loads consignments in a container or
       ULD the segment SGP and/or TPL following the CNI can be used to
       indicate in which equipment specified in the EQD-group on top
       level and/or which means of transport specified in the TDT-
       group on top level the consignment is loaded.
       
       Thus the short form IFCSUM-message operates as a reconciliation
       and control statement.
       
       - Extended form consolidation message
       
       In this situation, the data for each individual consignment has
       NOT been sent to the receiving partner by means of single
       consignment based messages (e.g. booking and/or instruction
       messages) separate to the IFCSUM message. In these
       circumstances it is possible to include the details of each
       consignment into the IFCSUM-message. In that case the segment
       (group) SGP and TPL following the segment CNI will not be used.
       For every consignment the complete structure of a single
       consignment based message can be used starting with the segment
       CNI replacing the BGM.
       
       Thus the extended form IFCSUM-message has not the function of
       referencing but to show as full a set of consignment data as is
       necessary to meet the requirements of type of consolidation
       message being constructed, e.g. Cargo vs. Full Freight.

1160      CNI, Consignment information
          A segment to indicate consignments included in the
          consolidation using the transport document/message number or
          to replace the segment BGM of a single consignment based
          message structure.
