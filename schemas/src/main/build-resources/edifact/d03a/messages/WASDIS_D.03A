0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Waste
       disposal information message (WASDIS) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to convey information on last inspection and/or on
       waste and cargo residues on board of a means of transport (e.g.
       vessel) and/or equipment related to a means of transport - and
       still to be disposed in the next place or port of call of the
       means of transport.

1.2    Field of application

       The Waste disposal information message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message has been designed to enable control of pollution
       caused by a means of transport, e.g. in the maritime and port
       environment. 
       * The message relates to one means of transport and/or
       equipment related to a means of transport. 
       * The message can be sent by a shipping agent to an authority
       (e.g. a port) or a centralized database of authorities
       * The message can be sent by an authority (e.g. a port)  to an
       authority in the next place or port of call of the means of
       transport (e.g. a vessel) or to a search or rescue organization
       Business area: control of pollution by a means of transport
       (e.g. maritime pollution)
