Audit Statement for the UN/EDIFACT Directory D.01B
     
This directory set is the official approved version of UN/EDIFACT 
Directory D.01B.
     
Following the preparation of the directory by the UN/Secretariat, 
it was examined by the Directory Audit Team (DAT) which has 
confirmed in a report to the UN/EDIFACT Working Group (EWG) Chair
and the UN/CEFACT Steering Group (CSG) that the content was 
prepared in accordance with approved procedures and is considered 
satisfactory for implementation.
     
A copy of the full audit report is available from the UN/ECE 
secretariat, e-mail: <cefact@unece.org>.
     
The directory is the final version of D.01B for user 
implementation. Under no circumstances will any corrigenda, 
addenda or revisions be issued.
     
If during implementation a user identifies what is considered to 
be an error, this should be notified in a Data Maintenance 
Request (DMR) to allow possible amendments in a subsequent official
approved version of UN/EDIFACT Directory.
     
A DMR form can be obtained from the nearest UN/EDIFACT Processing 
Point in either Brussels, Sydney, Tokyo or Washington D.C., who 
will advise the process to be followed for its submission and may 
assist in the completion of the form.
