NOTES:

(1) Each .zip file expands when "unzipped" (following the instructions
in the readme.txt file) to become the files listed underneath with the
exception of all content.txt references. These are found in this file
(below). 

(2) Chapter 2 of Part 5 does not include syntax service messages (e.g.
CONTRL) of UN/EDIFACT.

(3) Chapter 3 of Part 5 does not include service segments (tags
beginning with Uxx) defined in ISO 9735 (the EDIFACT syntax).  Version
control of these service segments is reflected in data element
0002 in the interchange header segment and is based on changes 
to ISO 9735. Therefore the usual UN/EDIFACT directory version/release
procedures for UN/EDIFACT messages (using data elements 0052 and 0054
in the message header segment and the functional group header segment)
is NOT applicable to those segments.

(4) Chapter 4 of Part 5 does not include service composite data
elements (the "Sxxx" series) which are defined in ISO 9735 (the
EDIFACT syntax).  Version control for these composite data elements
is reflected in data element 0002 in the interchange header segment
and is based on changes to ISO 9735. Therefore the usual UN/EDIFACT 
directory version/release procedures for UN/EDIFACT messages (using 
data elements 0052 and 0054 in composite S008, S009 and S306) is NOT
applicable to those composite data elements.

(5) Chapter 5 of Part 5 does not include service data elements (the
"0xxx" series) which are defined in ISO 9735 (the EDIFACT syntax).
Version control for these data elements is reflected in data element
0002 in the interchange header segment and is based on changes to 
ISO 9735. Therefore the usual UN/EDIFACT directory version/release 
procedures for UN/EDIFACT messages (using data elements 0052 and 0054) 
is NOT applicable to those data elements.

(6) Under development.

(7) Under review - may contain information about the UN/EDIFACT
organisation which is no longer valid.


PART 5    UNITED NATIONS DIRECTORIES FOR ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE
                 FOR ADMINISTRATION, COMMERCE AND TRANSPORT

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

This Part 5 of the UN/EDIFACT directories shall in each successive
issue include: 

     all unchanged, changed and new UN Standard Message Types (UNSMs)
     and their supporting directories agreed for public use by 
     UN/CEFACT. 

In the directories, UNSMs are specified in the chapter xdmd,
supporting segments in xdsd, composite data elements in xdcd, data
elements in eded and code lists in uncl and unsl (where x=e for the 
batch directory set, and x=i for the interactive directory set).

Additions, changes and deletions in a new issue will be marked in
reference to the previous issue of directory.

The data element part of the UN Trade Data Element Directory (UNTDED),
of which Eded (the Data element directory within the standard
directory) is an excerpt in condensed form, is also ISO standard 7372
for which there is a UN/ECE-ISO agreement for the Maintenance Agency,
ISO 7372 MA.

The complete contents of the current directory, as well as the
diskette files in which this information can be found, are listed in
the table of contents in the diskette file content.txt.
