0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Cargo/goods
       handling and movement message (HANMOV) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message may be used both
       for national and international trade. It is based on universal
       commercial practice and is not dependent on the type of
       business or industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       This message includes two functionalities :
       
       - a message from a party to a warehouse/distribution centre
       identifying the handling services and where required the
       movement of specified goods.
       
       - a message from a logistic service provider (i.e. warehouse,
       logistic center, distribution center) to an ordering party
       reporting the handling services status and where required the
       movement of specified goods.
       
       Both are limited to warehouses within the jurisdiction of the
       distribution centre.

1.2    Field of application

       The Cargo/goods handling and movement message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message addresses the indirect flow of goods between
       seller and buyer through a warehouse/distribution center and
       the report related to  this indirect flow.
       
       The functions of this message are limited to:
       
       - assembly/disassembly of goods and products, without
       interfering in the manufacturing process 
       - (re-)packing/unpacking
       - control of goods associated with the handling services but
       not interfering in the manufacturing process
       - marking and labelling on the packages of the goods but does
       not extend to the marking and labelling of the products 
       - movement of goods limited between warehouses within the
       jurisdiction of the distribution center 
       - preparation of goods for shipment
       - storage 
       - clearance
       - goods inspection
       - hazardous material handling
       - status reporting
       
       The status message may be sent: 
       
       - as the result of request(s) for consignment(s) or equipment
       status(es)
       - on a scheduled basis at predetermined times
       - on the occurrence of a selected event(s)
       - on the occurrence of an exceptional event as agreed by the
       partners involved.
       
       The movement of specified goods relates here to the area where
       control of the goods is to be exercised from the arrival of the
       goods to the distribution center until the departure of the
       goods from the distribution center to another party. 
       
       It can include movements between warehouses within the
       jurisdiction of the distribution center. Other movements of
       goods will be given by the relevant instruction messages, i.e.
       IFTMIN (Instruction message) and Instruction For Despatch
       (message under development).
       
       The functions Assembly/Disassembly are meant to make the goods
       ready for delivery to the final customer, they are not part of
       the actual manufacturing or assembly process.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerised.
       - A goods item may be in one or pieces of equipment, and a
       single equipment may contain one or more goods items.
       - One goods item and/or line item may be related to one or more
       customs tariff codes.
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it,
       e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to another load
       or transport device, which as such may be attached to yet
       another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis
       on a railway wagon.
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement
       on their own, are specified in the transport details group.
       Other load or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       - The expression of packaging for goods items in the GID
       segment can be expressed at up to three levels.
