General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Utilities
       master data message (UTILMD) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       The Utilities master data message is sent between responsible
       parties in a utilities infrastructure for the purpose of
       exchanging characteristics of objects and services. In addition
       the Utilities master data message may be used to request
       information.
       
       A party in a utilities infrastructure can for example be a net
       owner, a supplier, a balance responsible or a transmission
       system operator.

1.2    Field of application

       The Utilities master data message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The Utilities master data message is used for exchanging
       characteristics of objects and services in the specified field,
       normally used for updating data bases with administrative and
       technical information of long validity, such as information
       concerning customers, partners and installations. The
       information may be of technical or administrative character,
       such as characteristics of a meter, tariffs, suppliers etc.
       
       In addition the Utilities master data message may be used to
       request information.
        
       Each set of master data can be identified according to its
       nature, e.g. by a metering point identification or a location
       identification. The message may be an initial message and does
       not require a response.
       
       Examples of use are:
        Information regarding change of supplier, such as:
        Request for end user information.
        Information regarding the characteristics of an end user. 
        Information about change of supplier.
        Information of contract termination from an end user.
        Exchange of changes in characteristics of objects or services
       between parties in a utilities infrastructure.
        Change of identity of an object.
        Change of components or characteristics of components, such as
       change of a meter.

       it. It will normally contain information of long validity.
